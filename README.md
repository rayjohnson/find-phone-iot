IOT Button -> "Find my iPhone"

AWS lambda function for iot button


My wife miss places her phone on occasion.  She will often ask me to use the
"Find my iPhone" feature of iCloud to get that nice submarine ping going to find
her phone.  She has even been known to call me at work from the land-line to 
have me trigger it!  I've tried to teach her to do it herself - no luck...

So - enter the AWS IOT Button.  This project gives a little AWS lambda function
that can be configured to run for a button push.  It then calls iCloud and plays
the find my iPhone sound.  What could be more simple!
